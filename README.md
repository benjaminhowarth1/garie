### Capturing data

You can capture data anyway you want. You could setup a cron job to hit the application every X amount of times to gather information or a github webhook with any release of your software.

#### Lighthouse

##### GET - `localhost:8080/lighthouse?url={url}&product={product}`

- url - The url to get the performance data for.
- product - The product which is used on the dashboards.

Example: `http://localhost:8080/lighthouse?url=http://www.google.co.uk&product=google`

#### Page speed insights

##### GET - `localhost:8080/page-speed-insights?url={url}&product={product}`

- url - The url to get the performance data for.
- product - The product which is used on the dashboards.

Example: `http://localhost:8080/page-speed-insights?url=http://www.google.co.uk&product=google`
